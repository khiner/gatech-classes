	abstract = {Available expressions are reviewed and new ones derived for the inverse of the sum of two matrices, one of them being nonsingular. Particular attention is given to (A + UBV)-1, where A is nonsingular and U, B and V may be rectangular; generalized inverses of A + UBV are also considered. Several statistical applications are discussed.},
