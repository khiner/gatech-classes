### Background

Delia Derbyshire was a musician, composer, and producer renowned for her work composing themes and segments for many popular radio and TV shows in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop (Holmes). Pot Pourri was Delia's first piece made by combining sound sources and sequences she composed and produced for various BBC programs at the Radiophonic Workshop circa 1965 (https://wikidelia.net/wiki/Pot_Au_Feu).
Produced six years after joining the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, where she immediately produced her famous electronic version of the "Doctor Who" theme, this piece showcases Delia's broad range of talent and ingenuity in composition, production, and tape editing, as well as her mastery over reel-to-reel tape machine performance and loop synchronization.

The piece's unique and eccentric compositional style also foreshadows the wildly inventive and subversive "An Electric Storm" album Delia would produce just one year later with her "White Noise" electric pop group.

**Listen for:** Complex rhythms created by synchronizing multiple tape loops composed of a single, re-pitched sound source. Try and catch single sounds used in different manners and contexts. Also, pay attention to the composition of the segments and how simple elements are combined to create a uniquely off-kilter, eerie, insistent quality.

**0:00-0:20**

Introducing the piece is a lowpass-filtered noise with frequency cutoff swept from low to high to introduce higher frequencies and volume.


**0:20-0:30**

A bass melody composed of three notes, accompanied by a series of high-pitched swelling, ringing plucked tones, and a quiet rattling sound, introduces the piece's main content.
The bass sound is inharmonic with a broad spectrum and is likely created from a percussion instrument slowed down (https://wikidelia.net/images/d/d1/Delia_Derbyshire%27s_Creative_Process.pdf).
As explained by Delia in a 1965 episode of "Tomorrow's World" (https://youtu.be/qsRuhCflRyg?t=164), the high-pitched sounds with sharp attacks heard here were produced using a plucked zither string.
Here, one can hear the plucking sound overlapped with itself, reversed, and pitched a semitone apart to create an unsettling undulating sound.


**0:30-1:00**

The main melody line uses the same zither pluck sound and is still accompanied by the other elements until the bass ends the section.


**1:00-1:15**

This is a section from the BBC radio program, "Finnish Science and Technology," produced by Derbyshire in 1965 (https://wikidelia.net/wiki/Finnish_Science_and_Technology).
It consists of an amplified electric guitar note re-pitched by varying playback tape speeds to form the low notes (https://wikidelia.net/images/d/d1/Delia_Derbyshire%27s_Creative_Process.pdf), along with an insistent high-pitched lead melody that sounds similar to the zither sound mentioned earlier.
Following this is a stuttering rhythmic pattern that starts and stops unpredictably.
The rhythm sources a woodblock's re-pitched sounds (via resampling on different tape playback speeds) (https://youtu.be/qsRuhCflRyg?t=159), and a pitched ringing percussive sound with a longer decay sounding like a glass material struck with a soft mallet, all processed with reverb.


**1:15-1:39**

Cut to a quick 4/4 tick-tock rhythm and a two-note down-pitched guitar line.
The quarter notes in the rhythm sound like a sample of the same woodblock sound with raised pitch.
A dotted-sixteenth-note pattern from a much higher-pitched clacking wooden percussion sound accompanies the main beat.
Following, a buzzy and crisp monophonic synth lead with an inharmonic timbre playing a distinct melody with light reverb.
The "Finnish Science and Technology" rhythm from the previous section returns with three punctuated stabs by the bass and lead on the same note to wrap the section.


**1:40-2:00**

This is a section of a piece by Delia called "Way Out in Piccadilly."
It is in 11/8 time, which Delia says is in direct response to Dave Brubeck's experiments with 5- and 7-time.
She said in an interview later, "I thought, 'Fine! I'm into the numbers game. I'll do eleven time and thirteen time", continuing the series of prime numbers.' (https://wikidelia.net/wiki/Radio_Scotland_interview)

All of the sounds in the rhythm came from the same recorded wood block sound, pitched up and down by speeding up or slowing down the tape playback.
The re-pitched sounds were recorded onto another tape, then cut into sections of precise length and joined together in a tape loop (https://youtu.be/qsRuhCflRyg?t=198).
A series of sparsely arranged stabbing dyads with interspersed connective single notes, using the same plucked zither sound used earlier.
Underlying each stab is a synthesized tone to fill out the sound.
A spectrally rich ringing sound swells in and out of the mix to pad the background with an eerie presence.
The sound is reminiscent of a metallic singing bowl (although I can find no reference for its source).


**2:00-2:30**

The singing-bowl sound rises, and the low wood block thump slows and dies out as a swelling high-pitched wavering tone similar to a bowed string rises quickly.
This leads up to the most dramatic moment of the track - an insistent, driving rhythm composed of a single piercing high note.
The tone is also sourced from the plucked zither and uses the same tape-loop method as the wood blocks to create the rhythm. (https://youtu.be/qsRuhCflRyg?t=230).


**2:30-2:50**

The "Way Out" 11/8 rhythm and zither dyads return, now accompanied by a theremin-like melody with glissando and slightly wavering pitch, evoking a Bernard Hermann sci-fi score.


**2:50-3:12**

Delia's signature tune for "Finnish Science and Technology" returns to conclude (Finnish) the piece.
