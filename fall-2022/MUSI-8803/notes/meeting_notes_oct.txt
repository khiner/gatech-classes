TODO this & next week:

- Karl: Scrape Chordify data for > 2018 & potentially getting more chords in past years too, since we don't have many
- Sile: Billboard data - unique songs & billboard entry date, and filtering out songs already in billboard chordify.

Things to think about with sampling:
- Imbalance in total number of Billbaord Top-N (100, 20, etc) per-year
- Would be nice to have a similar distribution of metrics representing songs' "popularity" for each period (year)
    - E.g. Distribution of peak position in each year
