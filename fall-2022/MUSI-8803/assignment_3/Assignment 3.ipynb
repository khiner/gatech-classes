Also, importantly, the rules for the day segment depend on the month segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the month segment as an example. We are validating the number is between 1 and 12, inclusive. The character group `[1-9]` represents a valid month, with no false positives, but it misses three months, `10`, `11`, and `12`. We can capture these cases with `1[0-2]`, giving us a working month segment of `([1-9]|1[0-2])`. This is fine, but it's hard to parse the simple idea it's capturing, \"a number between 1 and 12\". We can successfully apply this same idea (of separately handling each case in an OR-group) to the more difficult issue of validating the day segment based on each month, but it would be overly complex and difficult to interpret.\n",

Then I would convert each group to an integer type, and perform the validation using more natural conditional logic like:\n",
