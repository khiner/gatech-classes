    "\n",
    "Each of the segments (month/day/year) has its own, separate requirements for the number, and using a regular expression would require separate rules for one vs two digits (or two vs four digits for the year segment). Also, importantly, the rules for the day segment depend on the month segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the month segment as an example. We are validating the number is between 1 and 12, inclusive. The character group `[1-9]` represents a valid month, with no false positives, but it misses three months, `10`, `11`, and `12`. We can capture these cases with `1[0-2]`, giving us a working month segment of `([1-9]|1[0-2])`. This is fine, but it's hard to parse the simple idea it's capturing, \"a number between 1 and 12\". We can successfully apply this same idea (of separately handling each case in an OR-group) to the more difficult issue of validating the day segment based on each month, but it would be overly complex and difficult to interpret.\n",

    "Instead, I would use a high-level programming language for this task. I would make a small change regular expression above to add capture groups to each segment, `(\\d\\d?)[-\\/](\\d\\d?)[-\\/](\\d{2,4})`. Then I would convert each group to an integer type, and perform the validation using more natural conditional logic like:\n",
