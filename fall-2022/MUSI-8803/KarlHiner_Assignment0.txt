Karl Hiner: MUSI-8808 Assignment 0

1) Name or describe something that you have learned in class so far that you have enjoyed learning about and/or seen value in learning.

I have enjoyed being exposed to academic papers in Music Informatics. I had very little knowledge coming into this class what the field is about beyond a very broad sense of it. I also appreciate the emphasis on hypothesis-driven research. This is something I have very little practice with, and I enjoy the challenge of exercising this part of my brain, as my natural tendancy is to approach things exploratively.

2) Name or describe something that you feel you are struggling with, or do not yet understand or 'have a good grasp of', or feel that you do not see the connection to 'the bigger picture' with.

From the "big picture" perspective, I am curious about the research community, some of their common broad goals, what some of the "major results" are in the field, if/how the research outcomes feed into other areas like commercial industry, and what common challenges CM researchers face in making a broad impact.

3) Name or describe something that you are hoping to learn in the class that you have not learned yet.

I am most looking forward to learning approaches and techniques for quantifying inference over large (or small!) musical corpora. What inferences can we reasonably make based on the mid/high-level features we derive? How do we reason about the various forms of uncertainty we run into, from methodological/data errors to imprecise definitions/operationalization?
