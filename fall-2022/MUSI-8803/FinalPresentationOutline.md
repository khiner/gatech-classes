# Is the I–V–vi–IV Chord Progression Becoming Less Popular?

## Chord-Ratio Methodology 

In order to test our hypothesis, we tried a few different methodologies to reveal an accurate representation of our data.
Initially, we simply graphed how many times the I-V-vi-IV progression occurred every year.

Upon first glance, it’s clear that the utilization of the I-V-vi-IV progression peaked around 2008 and has steadily declined since.
However, we weren’t convinced this was the best way to formally test our hypothesis.

## Chord-Ratio Methodology

We then opted to calculate ratios that would represent the the amount of times the I-V-vi-IV progression occurred in relation to the total amount of chord progressions for each year (in our case, chord progressions are quadgrams consisting of an initial chord and the three following chords).
The finalized ratios consisted of the total amount of the I-V-vi-IV progression and its rotations over the total amount of progressions for every year.


## Chord-Ratio Methodology I

There are clear differences in the graphs aforementioned, however, we decided to continue forward with quadgram ratios as we didn’t think the data was terribly different.
One thing of note was the fact that we uncovered interesting phenomena that we weren’t necessarily looking for.
The quadram data made it very clear that the utilization of chord progressions overall has declined since 1991.
It’s quite possible that the proliferation of genres such as hip-hop and rap (that are primarily loop-based) may have skewed the data, but it’s an interesting find nonetheless.

## Chord-Ratio Methodology II

We decided that quadgram chord-ratio methodology was the most accurate representation of our data and utilized that method to calculate our results:
