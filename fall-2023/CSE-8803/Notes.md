# Notes for 8803

## Inspiration

A collection of inspiring GNN-related papers:

(Also see [mesh2audio Notes.md](https://github.com/khiner/mesh2audio/blob/main/Notes.md) - this ties in since it's in mesh land!)

- Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks
  - Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03409
  - Video: https://youtu.be/KfZFgSff9N8?si=6DxM6LYEDGSRh2RI
  - This one _is_ GNN-based.
- Learning to Simulate Complex Physics with Graph Networks
  - In the MLG reading list.
- Temporal Graph Networks for Deep Learning on Dynamic Graphs
  - In the MLG reading list.
